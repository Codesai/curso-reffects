# Todos

## First iteration

Implement a todos application where you can write things to do and mark them as done or not. For the moment, they will be saved in the React state, so you'll lose them on refresh.

##Â Second iteration

Starting from the previous code, save the todos into the localStorage so you don't lose what you wrote. Keep in mind that you'll have to implement custom effects and coeffects to handle the localStorage.
